# GitHub Action for Tekton

This GitHub Action provides [`tkn`](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli) for interacting with [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/). 

Tekton is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) systems. It lets users build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.
